# Fishing 

stardew valley fishing minigame  

- Basically depending on the size of the fish or the rarity the more difficult the game is
- when you use one of the poles from the mod, whether is a large or regular
- with the regular pole you can only catch certain fish, but the size affecting difficulty
- the large Pole is more expensive to craft and can catch large fish, sharks manta ray etc

- shows generic fish so what you catch is a surprise
- the bar is smaller and a different color Green is Common, Yellow is uncommon, Red is rare. 
- all of those with smaller catch bars with increasing rarities making it difficult.
- the red bar fishes, you need a " Big ol' Bucket" which is just a bucket with 4 iron above it (suppose these are the large pole ones)
- enchant rod to make it easier
- triggered by vanilla fishing

The goal of the fishing mini-game is to keep the small fish icon within the green rectangle
until the progress bar to the right is completely filled. If the fish's icon moves above or
below the green rectangle, the progress bar decreases, and the fish escapes if the progress bar
reaches the bottom.

- when you catch you get an item for that fish
- should you be able to right click on water with the item to place it back as an entity
- also have like a suffocation bar on the item so it dies if you dont place it in water / bucket quickly enough

so a fishing recipe would be
- time (how long it takes to fill the progress bar)
- activity (how often it moves)
- speed (how often far moves)
- randomness (how much the fish moves around)
- rod required
- what item it gives
- rarity [common, uncommon, rare] (sets defaults for below)
- bar colour (related to rarity)
- bar size (related to rarity)
- biomes, time of day,

ASSETS for every fish
- item icon
- bucket item icon
